                    <p>We must be quiet, soft and gentle. I'm gonna start with a little Alizarin crimson and a touch of Prussian blue The only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow.

                    We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted. Even the worst thing we can do here is good. Poor old tree.</p>

                    <p>Have fun with it. Nothing's gonna make your husband or wife madder than coming home and having a snow-covered dinner. I'm gonna start with a little Alizarin crimson and a touch of Prussian blue We'll lay all these little funky little things in there.

                        If these lines aren't straight, your water's going to run right out of your painting and get your floor wet. These things happen automatically. All you have to do is just let them happen. Pretend you're water. Just floating without any effort. Having a good day. I think there's an artist hidden in the bottom of every single one of us.</p>

                    <p>We don't have to be concerned about it. We just have to let it fall where it will. It's a super day, so why not make a beautiful sky? Happy painting, God bless. A tree cannot be straight if it has a crooked trunk.

                        You create the dream - then you bring it into your world. Just beat the devil out of it. Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over here. The only prerequisite is that it makes you happy. If it makes you happy then it's good.</p>

                    <p>Use your imagination, let it go. You can't have light without dark. You can't know happiness unless you've known sorrow. Almost everything is going to happen for you automatically - you don't have to spend any time working or worrying.

                        The more we do this - the more it will do good things to our heart. Happy painting, God bless. You got your heavy coat out yet? It's getting colder.</p>
